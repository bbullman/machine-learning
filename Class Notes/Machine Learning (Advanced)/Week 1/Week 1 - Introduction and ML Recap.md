* An algorithm is a self-contained set of rules or instructions used to solve problems
* Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly programming them, by using data to learn
* The problems ML tries to solve:
	* Predicton: Supervised Learning
	* Finding Structure in Data: Unsupervised Learning
	* Mimicking Human Behavior: Reinforcement Learning

LLMs are Supervised Learning. They try to predict based on data - either a word, or a pixel, or a waveform even.
