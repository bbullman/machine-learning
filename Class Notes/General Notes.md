The course uses the book [Introduction To Statistical Learningi](https://trevorhastie.github.io/ISLR/]) available here by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshiran. I've chosen to use the Python version of the course.

## Note on the Labs

These are my unfiltered, error-prone labs. There's solution labs that I'll try to include as well, where the errors are probably mitigated. However I try to update my labs to the latest version of Keras, Sklearn, Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow/PyTorch, etc.

I do use Tensorflow as a Keras backend since it's a default for this course, but I do recommend using PyTorch as well.
